USE CASE DESCRIPTION SAMPLE
------------------------------------------------
Preconditions:
● Conversation messages available
● User translation history accessible
● Context processing enabled
Basic Flow (Main Success Scenario):
1. Translation service receives context request
2. Context processor analyzes recent messages
3. System extracts relevant entities and topics
4. System builds enhanced context metadata
5. Translation incorporates context for better accuracy
6. System updates user profile with learned patterns
Alternative Flows:
● Entity extraction: identify anime characters, tech terms, places
● Topic classification: anime discussion, technical conversation, etc.
● Feedback processing: learn from user corrections
● Profile management: adapt to user preferences
Postconditions:
● Enhanced translation context available
● User profile updated with new patterns

title Context-Aware Translation

|Translation Service|
start
:Receive context-aware translation request;
:Retrieve conversation messages;

|Context Processor|
:Analyze message sequence;
:Extract entities (characters, places, terms);
:Classify conversation topic;

if (Topic detected?) then (yes)
    :Calculate topic confidence;
    :Identify key patterns;
else (no)
    :Use general context;
endif

:Build context metadata;
:Enhance translation prompt;

|Translation Service|
:Generate context-aware translation;
:Apply user preferences;

if (Translation successful?) then (yes)
    :Return enhanced translation;
    :Store context for future use;
else (no)
    :Fallback to basic translation;
endif

:Process any feedback provided;
:Update user profile;
